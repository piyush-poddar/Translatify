## Real Time Language Translation for global audio/video communication

In a globalized world, language barriers still limit effective communication. Whether it's in business meetings, classrooms, or virtual interactions, people struggle to understand each other across languages.

## Project Overview:
Our project provides a real-time language translator for virtual meetings, like Google Meet, allowing two people to communicate seamlessly in different languages. One person speaks in English, the other in Hindi, and each hears the translated version of what the other is saying-all in real time.

## Technology Used:
This tool uses Python, Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech APIs, and translation services, along with virtual audio routing, to ensure smooth, immediate language conversion.

### This is the future of communication, breaking language barriers and enabling effortless globalÂ communication.
